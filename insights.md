- If you're messaging or using a textbox and there's a submit button, use it. Sometimes pressing enter won't work. Can double check if it went through with a screenshot.

Often used apps that aren't common that you should consider their UI seriously:

Superhuman: The subject line is below the "to" field when composing an email, unlike traditional email clients.

Arc Browser: Chromium based browser with similar shortcuts to Chrome. Use `open -a Arc`. It has a sidebar for managing tabs and spaces, different from the traditional tab bar at the top.

Texts.com App: Use `open -a Texts`. The main chat interface is minimalistic and focuses on conversation threads, unlike traditional messaging apps with more cluttered interfaces.

ClickUp: Use `open -a ClickUp`. It uses a hierarchical structure with spaces, folders, lists, and tasks, which can be more complex compared to traditional project management tools.

Notion Calendar: Use `open -a Notion Calendar`. The calendar view is integrated with other databases and pages, offering a more interconnected experience compared to standalone calendar apps.
